He draws his influence from all over the spectrum: the offbeat comedy of Jonathan Coulton, the rock edge of the Foo Fighters, the cerebral quirkiness of Ben Folds\u2014 yet his sound is undeniably unique. His songs walk the fine line between raw emotional content and fantastical escapism. On stage he takes on the role of a starship captain traveling from planet to planet and bringing his piano rock show to the locals wherever he lands\u2026 or crashes. With robot shipmates, alien antagonists, and a ship perpetually on the brink of flying apart, Ebel keeps audiences entertained while he keeps his crew from being blown to space dust. Ebel's been writing and performing music his entire life, earning a degree in Music from Whitworth University and playing stages like the Grand Ole Opry and Boston's own Roxy theater.  He's also produced sci-fi music shows like the High Orbit podcast and Live at the Coffee Bunker, and has recently voiced the Phoenix Conspiracy audiobooks by sci-fi author Richard L. Sanders.
